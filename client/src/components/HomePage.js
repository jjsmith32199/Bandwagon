              Bandwagon is a web application that allows users to create a road
              trip itinerary based on their music preferences. Users can enter a
              starting location and ending location, and Bandwagon will generate
              a road trip itinerary with stops at cities along the way. The
              cities are chosen based on the userâ€™s music preferences, and the
              itinerary is generated using the Google Maps API. Users can save
              their itineraries and view them later.
